The goal for my project was to create the application with simplicity in mind, that also felt fluid to use.

**Tools**
React
Netlify, for hosting
Axios, for API requests
Material UI

**Specified Features**
Search and Nominate
Notification For 5 Nominations
Local Storage for Nominations
Mobile Friendly 

**Reflections**
This project has taught me a lot. If I was to do it all over again, I would approach the project in a very different way. I would start from the basics, creating a clear design for the application rather than rushing to quick solutions (regardless of timelines). The biggest learning for me is that it is better to have no code on the board than haphazard code.
